# Tanks
Tanks is a reimagining of an old flash 2-dimensional game where players could battle to be the last man standing.
Tanks uses JAMA 1.0.3 and MigLayout 4.0:
* http://www.miglayout.com
* http://math.nist.gov/javanumerics/jama/

System Requirements: Java 8

How to use: 

If you have an executable jar file simply run that. (please note, executables are not provided. If you know one of the developers you might have gotten one from them) If you are on a UNIX system you may also run it with "java - jar fileName.jar"

If you don't have an executable jar file please download the source code from Github. Compile the program using Java's compiler and run that executable. Please note, you MUST have MigLayout 4.0 and the latest version of JAMA in order for the program to compile.

Once the game starts the user can move between menus to set up games and access help pages for all other documnetation on how to play the game.
